<h1>About me</h1> 
</div>

<p>I am an electronic engineer, passionate about software development and currently focused on Big data, working as a Data Engineer/Data Architect.</p>
<p>In my experience, I have had the opportunity to work with many areas and work with backend and infrastructure tools in on-premise and cloud environments, which has given me a comprehensive view of the processes.</p>
<p>I love the idea of building things with software, and even more so if they were considered impossible before, that's the reason why I always try to learn new things and share my knowledge and my code with the community.</p>
<p>In my free time, I like to experiment with hardware using tools like Arduino or Raspberry Pi, using them with different types of sensors to test temperature, movement, etc, or just emulate a remote server with RaspberryPi..</p>

<p>And I'm also a fan of good coffee</p>
